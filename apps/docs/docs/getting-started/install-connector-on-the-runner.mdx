# Install connector on the runner

Add connector Key with the version or branch to the runner configuration file.

Provide required and optional configuration parameters for the connector.
See connector definition file to see the configuration parameters for the connector.

NOTE: You don't need to deploy the connector on the runner, the runner will download it automatically from the specified GitHub repository and the specified version or branch

After you installed all the connectors you need, restart the runner so it uses the new configuration if you run it locally.
Or re-deploy the runner if you run it in a cloud.
