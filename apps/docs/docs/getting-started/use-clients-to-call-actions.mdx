# Use clients to call actions

Authorize client to work with your runner by providing:

- Runner URL
- API Key

Every client has their own process how to configure the access to the runner. 
Please refer to the client documentation for more details.

We recommend to use a seperate API Key for every client.

You can specify API key in the Runner configuration file.
