## Natural Language Actions

Runner uses LLMs to understand natural language requests from users,
classify the intent, identify the input parameters and run the action.
At the moment Connery provides [native client for Slack](/docs/native-clients/slack) which
utilizes this feature and allows users to run action using natural language.
Even though this is a convenient way run actions from the runner, it is completely optional.

Currently supported LLMs:
