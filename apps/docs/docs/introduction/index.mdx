# Introduction

Connery is an open-source platform designed to simplify the integration between AI agents, no-code automations, and real-world applications. It serves as a foundational layer for building and managing connectors.

### Core Features

- **Standardized framework** for developing connectors that facilitate interactions between third-party apps and AI agents.
- **Open-source modules and components** to accelerate the development process.
- **Security measures** to mitigate risks associated with AI-driven actions.
- **Community-driven ecosystem** for sharing and adapting connectors across various AI platforms.

### Project Goals

Our aim is to streamline the development of AI agents by offering:

1. A **common standard** for building and automating third-party connectors and actions for AI agents.
2. **Cross-platform compatibility** to ensure seamless integration with various development and automation platforms.
3. **Testing utilities** to validate and control agent behavior.

### Open source

We're committed to open-source principles, as we believe that collective development accelerates innovation. Connery is open-source, and we encourage contributions to help us achieve our goals.

### Platform components

**Details**

1. Open-source **Connectors** built by the community serving various purposes. Every connector is a separate open-source GitHub repository maintained by the community.
2. Companies or individuals configure their own isolated **Runner** with a unique connector set and configuration. You may also start with pre-built runners.
3. The **Runner pulls connectors** from GitHub based on the runner configuration.
4. The **Runner exposes actions** to clients and end users based on access configurations.
5. End users use **clients** to automate their work in different ways from different places. Additionally, anyone can build their own clients based on the runner API.
6. The Runner establishes secure and persistent connections to **third-party services** for every installed connector.
7. (optional) The Runner uses Large Language Models (LLM) to **support Natural Language Actions**. LLM can enable the Runner to classify user intent, identify input parameters and run actions based on user prompt. This is optional. Any Runner can also be used without LLM.
