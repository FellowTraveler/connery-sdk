# Introduction

## Conector ecosystem

![Connector ecosystem](/img/connery_connector_ecosystem_diagram.jpeg)

1. Community builds open source connectors for many different purposes.
Every connector is a separate open source GitHub repo (similar to GitHub Actions).
2. Every company or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique connector set and configuration. 
3. Runner pulls needed connectors from GitHub.
4. End users use clients to automate their work in different ways.
5. Runner exposes actions to clients and end users based on the access configuration.
6. Runner uses LLMs to classify user intent and identify action parameters based on the user prompt.
7. Runner securely keeps connections to third-party services for every installed connector.
