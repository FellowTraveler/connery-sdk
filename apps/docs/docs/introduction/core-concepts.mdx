# Core concepts

Here, you can find the core concepts of the Connery platform and their definitions.
We highly recommend you read this section before diving into the documentation.

## Connector

A connector is a collection of actions closely related by meaning and function.
The connector provides a shared configuration for all its actions.
Each connector is represented by a public or private GitHub repository configured in a specific way.
Before a connector can be used, it must be installed on a runner.
Once set up, its actions are accessible and can be run from any client.

:::info Example
A [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) connector has a set of actions related to Gmail.
For example, SendEmail is one of them.
The connector requires GmailEmailAddress and GmailAppPassword configuration parameters
during the installation on the runner, so the actions can establish a connection to the Gmail account using them.
:::

You might already be familiar with the concept of a connector.
This idea has different names across various platforms:

- **Plugin** in ChatGPT;
- **Tool** in LangChain;
- **App** in Make, Zapier, and Slack.

## Action

An action is an atomic operation designed to perform a specific task.
You can think of an action as a function with input and output parameters that can be called from many places (clients).

:::info Example
The [SendEmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/actions/SendEmail.js) action of
the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) connector has Recipient, Subject, and Body input parameters.
Once a client runs the action, it sends an email based on the provided input parameters
and returns a MessageId to the client as a result.
:::

## Runner

A runner is an open-source application to host and run actions.
Every company or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique connector set and configuration.
Runner provides a security layer and access control for actions and their execution.

## Client

A client is an application that allows end users to run actions from the runner.

:::info Example
[Connery Slack App](/docs/native-clients/slack) is a client that allows users to run actions from the runner right
from the Slack workspace using natural language.
