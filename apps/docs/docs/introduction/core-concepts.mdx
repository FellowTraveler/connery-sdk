# Core concepts

Below are the core concepts of Connery SDK.

## Action

Think of an action as a basic task, something like a function with input and output parameters designed to do one specific thing.

:::info Example

[Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts) is an action in
the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) _plugin_.

:::

## Plugin

The plugin is a way to organize _actions_, provide a common configuration for them, and expose them with a standard API to _clients_.

Each plugin is represented by a GitHub repository and uses Connery SDK to define the _actions_ and configuration.
Once the plugin is implemented, the Connery SDK wraps it into a web service that provides a standard API for interacting with its _actions_.

We aim to create a rich ecosystem of open-source plugins that empower the community.

:::info Example

A [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin has a set of _actions_ related to Gmail.

## Plugin server

## Client

A client is an adapter that allows you to run _actions_ from a specific platform or application.

:::info Example

An [OpenAI GPTs](/docs/clients/openai/gpt) client allows you to run _actions_ from OpenAI GPT,
a [Slack](/docs/clients/slack) client enables you to run _actions_ directly from Slack,
a [LangChain Toolkit](/docs/clients/langchain/toolkit) client allows you to run _actions_ from your own applications, and so on.
