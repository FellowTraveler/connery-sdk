# Use Cases

Connecting AI, workflow automation and real-world applications can serve many different use cases. Here is how we structure it.

Remember, the Connery approach is always the same:

1. **Get your custom connector**
   1. EITHER find a pre-built connector matching your task provided by the community
   2. OR build an own connector for your specific needs
2. Keep all your connector configuration in one place (on the runner) and **execute from any client**
   1. EITHER find a pre-built client matching your tooling provided by the community
   2. OR build your own client

## Run actions from multiple platforms

Connery is all about running actions. Once a connector and its actions become available in Connery they are exposed to several platforms. Our current strategy includes AI agent & chatbot platforms, Communication tooling and No-code automation platforms.

### AI agents and chatbots

Run your actions from any AI agent or chatbot platform. Connery currently provides a native client for LangChain Tool and is accessible through the Connery API. We plan to add more clients for other AI agent platforms.

### Communication tooling

Enable your team to run actions directly using natural language. Connery provides clients for communication tools. Currently available is our Slack Client. MS-Teams, Notion, Discord and others are likely to follow. You can always build your own client.

Automate frequent tasks and/or make multiple Apps accessible via direct communication.

- **Skill-enhancement**: Equip a less-skilled workforce to execute complex tasks without hand-over to specialized workforce, e.g. developers.
- **Scope broadening**: Enable workforce to perform more tasks across more tooling without learning new processes and tools.
- **Efficiency improvement**: Increase throughput by automating repetitive tasks.

### No-code automation

Automate more tasks by exposing customized actions to No-code platforms. Actions can be customized and simplified for optimal access from no-code users. Currently available is our Make (former Integromat) client. Zapier and other platforms are likely to follow. You can always build your own client.

## Use case examples

Most uses cases combine tools without knowing how they work or without changing the medium. While there is a myriad of potential use cases, find here a selection of use cases that inspired the Connery platform.

### Log HR absence, vacation or attendance and approvals via Slack

An employee logs a planned vacation, sick leave or attendance hours through Slack (or MS-Teams) that automatically triggers the absence logging and approval process via Personio or other HR tools.

This saves time and reduces friction for the employee and likely increases process accuracy.
