Slack is the natural environment where most of communication happen.

Automate frequent tasks or operations and save time for everyone:

- Let the team run the atumations in Slack instead of asking you to do it for them
- Save time and effort for the team on switching to another tools and learning how to use them

Collaborate with your team and run actions right from Slack using Connery App in Slack.
No need to learn a new tool and remind where the action is located, just ask Connery to do it for you using natural language and it's done.

## Run actions as a part of workflow in no-code tools

Like Make and Zapier
