# Toolkit

Use the Connery plugin infrastructure in your applications built with LangChain.
Run the Connery actions from agents, chatbots, or other applications.

:::warning IMPORTANT

This page is compatible with the [`v0.0.8`](https://github.com/connery-io/connery/releases/tag/v0.0.8) version of the Connery Runner.

In the meantime, we released [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/connery-io/connery/releases/tag/v0.1.0) with the **breaking changes**, where we pivoted the project from Connery Runner to Connery SDK.
See the release notes to learn more about the changes.

The LangChain Toolkit client does not yet support the new version, but we are working on it. Stay tuned for updates.

:::

Connery is natively integrated into LangChain through Toolkits.
