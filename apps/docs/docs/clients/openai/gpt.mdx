# GPTs

Use Connery actions in your OpenAI GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.

## Demo

See below a demo of how we use the [Send email](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail/blob/main/src/actions/sendEmail.ts) action from the [connery-io/gmail](https://github.com/connery-io/gmail) plugin in the GPT to write and send emails.

## Information

OpenAI released a custom version of ChatGPT that you can create for a specific purpose â€” called GPTs.
GPTs provide the ability to deeply customize ChatGPT with all new capabilities.
In addition to using the built-in capabilities, you can also define custom actions by making one or more APIs available to the GPT.
Actions allow GPTs to integrate external data or interact with the real world.
Connect GPTs to databases, plug them into emails, or make them your shopping assistant.

With Connery SDK, you can easily create a plugin with actions and use them in your GPTs.
See below how to set up Connery actions in your GPT.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. Use [this guide](/docs/quickstart/use-plugin) to set up the plugin server with actions you want to use in the GPT.
2. Prepare an OpenAI GPT where you want to use the actions.

:::info Important

Make sure your plugin server has [`PLUGIN_SERVER_URL`](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/configuration#plugin_server_url) environment variable set to the actual URL of the plugin server.
The value of the `PLUGIN_SERVER_URL` is used in the OpenAPI specification to let the GPT know where to send the requests to run the actions.

### Set up actions in the GPT

Once you have the plugin server up and running and the GPT ready, you can continue with the following steps to set up actions in the GPT.

1. **Get the OpenAPI specification** with all the actions from your plugin server.

   Use the [Interactive OpenAPI docs](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/rest-api#interactive-openapi-docs)
   to request the `/api/specs/openai/gpts` endpoint and get the OpenAPI specification for the OpenAI GPTs.

   Or send the following request from the terminal:

   ```

   curl -X 'GET' \
     '<PLUGIN_SERVER_URL>/api/specs/openai/gpts' \
     -H 'x-api-key: <API_KEY>'

   ```

   Replace `<PLUGIN_SERVER_URL>` and `<API_KEY>` with the actual values of your plugin server.

   Copy the OpenAPI specification from the response and save it to use in the next steps.

2. Open the **Configuration** section of your GPT.
3. Scroll down to the **Actions** section and click the **Create new action** button.

    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

4. Paste the OpenAPI specification you got from the plugin server into the **Schema** field.

   It should automatically load the actions from the specification and show them in the **Available actions** section under the **Schema** field.
   Check the list of actions imported from the OpenAPI specification.

5. Click the **Gear** button in the **Authentication** section to configure the authentication method for the actions.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-2@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

6. Select the **API Key** authentication type.
7. Paste the API Key of your plugin server into the **API Key** field.
8. Select the **Custom** auth type.
9. Use the `x-api-key` as a **Custom Header Name**.
10. Click the **Save** button.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/openai/actions-configuration-in-gpt-3@2x.png"
    alt="Actions configuration in GPT"
  />
</p>

11. Press **Update** on the top right corner to update the GPT, then press **Confirm** and **View GPT**.

Now, you're ready to use the actions in your GPT.
