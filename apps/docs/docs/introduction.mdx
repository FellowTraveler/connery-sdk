# Introduction

TODO: Add image "Connectors --> Runner --> Clients"

## Terminology

### Connector

A connector is a collection of closely related actions in meaning and function.
The connector provides a shared configuration and connection management for all its actions.

For example, the "Gmail" connector has "Send Email" and "Search Emails" actions.
Also, it has "Gmail Email Address" and "Gmail App Password" configuration parameters
provided during the connector installation and used by all the actions to access the Gmail account.

You might already be familiar with the idea of a Connector.
This idea has different names across various platforms.
In ChatGPT, it's a "plugin"; In LangChain, it's called a "tool"; And in Make, Zapier, and Slack - "app".

Each connector is represented by a GitHub repository set up in a specific manner.
It can be either public or private.
To use a Connector, it must first be installed on a runner.
Once installed, its actions can be run from any client.

### Action

An action is a singular operation designed to perform a specific task.
It can accept input parameters from the client and return output parameters upon execution.

For example, the Send Email action has Recipient, Subject, and Body input parameters.
Once the action is run by the client, it sends an email based on the provided input parameters and returns a Status as a result.

### Runner

### Client

Clients allows to call actions from the runner

Clients are usually proxies.

NOTES:

**Runner** is a personal server to host and run actions. Every company or individual configures their own isolated runner with a unique connector set and configuration.

**Clients**. End users apply clients to automate their work in different ways. They are executing actions exposed by the runner based on the access configuration. For example, our Slack App for executing less frequent and manual actions. Or LangChain Tool for exposing actions to agents for frequent, fully automated tasks. There are many other clients and use cases possible.
