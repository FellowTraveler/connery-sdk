# Third-party clients

:::tip

We are open to the community and encourage using and building third-party clients. 

:::

Use [Connery API](/docs/native-clients/api) or [LangChain Tool](/docs/native-clients/langchain) to build clients
and utilize the connector infrastructure from Connery.

If you built a client and want to share it with the community, 
please open a pull request to add your client to the list below.
