# Third-party clients

:::tip
We are open to the community and encourage everyone to build clients using
[Connery API](/docs/native-clients/api) or [LangChain Tool](/docs/native-clients/langchain)
and utilize the connector infrastructure from Connery for their needs.
:::

If you built a client and want to share it with the community, please open a pull request to add your client to the list.
