# CLI

The CLI allows you to streamline the development process of plugins and actions.

## Usage

The easiest way to use the CLI by using the `npx` command.
It will download the latest version of the CLI and run the command you pass to it.
Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally with `npm` and then run the command.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>

```
npx connery@latest [command]
```

We recommend using `@latest` to ensure you use the latest CLI version.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```
npm install -g connery
connery [command]
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
