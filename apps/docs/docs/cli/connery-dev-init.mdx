# `connery dev init`

Create all the necessary files and folders to start developing a new plugin.

Run this command at the root of your project.
You will be asked a few questions to configure the plugin, and then the CLI will create all the necessary files and configurations for the plugin.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>

```
npx connery@latest dev init
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```
connery dev init
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The newly initialized plugin is fully functional.
Its entry point is the `./src/index.ts` file, which contains the plugin definition.
Also, you can find the sample action defined in the `./src/actions/sampleAction.ts` file.
The sample action sums up two numbers and returns the result.
It is a good starting point for exploring and experimenting with the plugin.
Remove the sample action when you don't need it anymore.

The command also creates a `.env` file with the default [configuration](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/configuration) for the plugin server.
This file is added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to the repository.
We recommend changing the default values in the `.env` to your own values.
