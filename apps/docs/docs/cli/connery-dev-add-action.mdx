# `connery dev add-action`

Add a new action to the plugin.

Run this command at the root of your project.
You will be asked a few questions to configure the action and then the CLI will create the necessary files for it and add it to the plugin.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>

```
npx connery@latest dev add-action
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```
connery dev add-action
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The project must have been initialized with [`connery dev init`](/docs/cli/connery-dev-init) before running this command.
