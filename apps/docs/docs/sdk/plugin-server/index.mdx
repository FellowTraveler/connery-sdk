# Plugin server

The SDK wraps a plugin with a plugin server, a web service with a standardized REST API that makes the plugin's actions available across different clients.

The plugin server is running on port 4201.

Once the plugin server is running, you can access the plugin's main page at [http://localhost:4201](http://localhost:4201) in your browser.
