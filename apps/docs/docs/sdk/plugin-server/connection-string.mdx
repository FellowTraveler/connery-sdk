# Connection string

The connection string is a universal way to securely connect clients to your plugin server and allow them to work with the actions defined in the plugin.
The connection consists of key-value pairs separated by a semicolon. The key-value pairs are separated by an equal sign.

Example of connection string:

```
PLUGIN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4201;API_KEY=123456
```

## `PLUGIN_SERVER_URL`

Required: Yes

URL of the plugin server.

It should be the same value as the [`PLUGIN_SERVER_URL`](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/configuration#plugin_server_url) in the plugin server configuration,
and it should be the URL where the plugin server is running.

## `API_KEY`

Required: Yes

API key for the plugin server.

It should be the same value as the [`API_KEY`](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/configuration#api_key) in the plugin server configuration.
