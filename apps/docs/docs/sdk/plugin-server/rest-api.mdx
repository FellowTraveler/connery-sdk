# REST API

The SDK generates an OpepenAPI specification for the plugin, including the interactive docs based on Swagger UI.

## Interactive OpenAPI docs

You can access the Swagger UI at [http://localhost:4201/api](http://localhost:4201/api) while the plugin server is running.

To interact with the API, you must authorize using the API key you configured for the plugin.
For more information on configuring the API key, see the [configuration](/docs/sdk/plugin-server/configuration) page.

## OpenAPI specification

In case you need to access a raw OpenAPI specification, you can find it in the following formats:

- JSON: [http://localhost:4201/api-json](http://localhost:4201/api-json)
- YAML: [http://localhost:4201/api-yaml](http://localhost:4201/api-yaml)
