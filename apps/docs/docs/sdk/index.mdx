# SDK

The SDK is a collection of types and functions used to create AI plugins and actions.
It is written in TypeScript and is available as an NPM package.

## Installation

To install the SDK package into your project, run the following command:

```
npm install connery --save
```

:::info

In most cases, you will generate a new plugin using the CLI command [`connery dev init`](/docs/cli/connery-dev-init), which will automatically add the SDK package to the project.
