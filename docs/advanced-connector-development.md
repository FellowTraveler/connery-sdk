# Advanced connector development

## Develop on the local machine

## Automatic build

> (mode it to advanced section) Now your files are synchronized to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. The `main` branch is monitored by a GitHub Action workflow which automatically build and package your connector with all the dependencies into a `./dist/connector.js` file in the repository. This file is used by Connery Runner to run your connector.
> You can find the "Build connector" workflow in the "Actions" tab of the repository.
